1 THEN 2:

1) see if cvBlob will work

  2.4 How can I compile a simple program with gcc/g++ that uses cvBlob?
I usually use this Makefile in Kubuntu (considering that cvBlob is compiled and installed normally):

sample:      sample.cpp
        g++ `pkg-config opencv cvblob --cflags --libs` sample.cpp -o sample

For CVBlob class read:
 file:///home/robomakery/Code/slim/blob_detector/cvblob/doc/html/annotated.html


2) BackgroundSubtractorMOG, (not MOG2, it's not as good)
create class BackgroundSubtractor
then use apply(mat image, Mat fgmask)


Done
