OTHER NOTES

From http://openrave.org/docs/latest_stable/ikfast/  you can return return
the first solution found within limits using GetSolution(goal) . Also you
can do a manual check in your side as well.

Regarding limits: you can check for joints limits by using
robot.GetJoints()[i].GetLimits() . You can also set the limits using
SetLimits function for each joint.

Hope this is what you are looking for

Best Regards
Praveen
