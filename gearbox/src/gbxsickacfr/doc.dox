@brief ACFR driver for SICK laser range-finder.

Drives SICK hardware, directly connected to the computer. For a full list of classes and functions, see @ref gbxsickacfr.

@par Dependencies

- libIceUtil (for timing/threads/mutexes), v.3.2 or newer (latest tested 3.3).
- @ref gbx_library_gbxserialacfr

@par Installation

- Finding libIceUtil 
    - IceUtil will be found automatically if installed in one of several standard locations. 
    - You can specify it's installation point with @c ICEUTIL_HOME CMake variable (or an environment variable with the same name). For example:
@verbatim
$ cmake -DICEUTIL_HOME=/home/myuser/install .
@endverbatim

@par Limitations

- This is a Linux-only implementation.  
- It works with those serial devices which @ref gbx_library_gbxserialacfr supports.
- Currently, timestamps are generated whenever a @b full message
  arrives.  This is sub-optimal, since the message may take a
  significant amount of time to be transmitted over the serial
  interface.  eg. 181 samples at 38400 baud takes about 75ms.
  An improvement would be to timestamp the start of each message,
  remembering that timestamp for subsequent reads from the serial port
  until the end of the message finally arrives.
- Has been tested with: LMS-291, LMS-211.
