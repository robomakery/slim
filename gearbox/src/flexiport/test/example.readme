Building
--------

The examples can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the examples' source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed GearBox into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir flexiport_example
$ cd flexiport_example
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/gearbox/flexiport/example

Running serial_example
----------------------

This example requires a serial loopback device. You can make one by connecting
pins 2 and 3 of a 9-pin serial port. You must specify a path to this serial
port with the -d option. You may additionally specify extra options for the
flexiport object, such as a timeout. e.g.:

serial_example -o type=serial,device=/dev/ttyS0,baud=57600,timeout=2.5,debug=2

The example will test sending and receiving several strings to check that the
SerialPort object is functioning correctly.

This example also comes with a log file pair for use with the LogReaderPort
port type. Using a log file pair means the hardware (in this case, the loopback
device) does not need to be present to execute the example. You can use the
log file pair like this:

serial_example -o type=logreader,file=example.log

See the LogReaderPort object documentation for more options that can be used
with log file pairs. See the LogWriterPort object documentation for details
on how to make your own log file pair for testing your programs.

Running tcp_example
----------------------

The tcp_example is simple to use. Simply execute it, and it will fork off a
child process, then use this to test a connection between two TCPPort objects.

You may specify additional options for the TCPPort objects using -o, such as
a timeout. e.g.:

tcp_example -o timeout=1,debug=3

Running udp_example
----------------------

The udp_example is similar to the tcp_example, replacing the TCPPort object
with a UDPPort object.

You may specify additional options for the UDPPort objects using -o, such as
a timeout. e.g.:

udp_example -o timeout=1,debug=3

Note for Windows users
----------------------

Because Windows lacks a readily-available implementation of getopt, command line
options are not available for the examples on this platform. Hard-coded options
will be used instead; change them in the source file and recompile if you need
to change the port options.
