@page gbx_doc_installgentoo Installing GearBox on Gentoo Linux

@note Reviewed for release 1.1

These are detailed instructions for installing GearBox on Gentoo Linux. See @ref gbx_doc_getting for general guidelines.

@section gbx_doc_installgentoo_portageoverlay Portage overlay

The first step is to set up a local overlay for portage. If you already have a local overlay, you can skip this section.
If you don't know what an overlay is, see the <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/userguide.xml">Gentoo Documentation</a>.

Follow these simple steps to create an overlay:
-# Create a directory to store the overlay in, for example \b /usr/local/portage
-# Set the \b PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in \b /etc/make.conf to include this directory.

@section gbx_doc_installgentoo_copyebuild Download and copy ebuild

Download the Gearbox ebuild from the Gearbox download page. This ebuild must be copied into the local overlay so that portage can
find it. Extract the downloaded files into your local overlay directory. This should create a subdirectory called \b dev-libs with
a subdirectory called \b gearbox inside it.

@section gbx_doc_installgentoo_keywordebuild Keyword the ebuild

If the Gearbox ebuild is masked, it will need to be unmasked before it can be installed. Add the following line to /etc/portage/package.keywords
to unmask it.

@verbatim
dev-libs/gearbox **
@endverbatim

@section gbx_doc_installgentoo_setuseflags Set USE flags

This step is optional. If you wish to install Gearbox with the default options, move on to the next step.

The Gearbox ebuild provides many USE flags to control which libraries are installed. They can be set at install time by
specifying them on the command line, for example:

@verbatim
USE="hokuyo_aist" emerge gearbox -av
@endverbatim

Alternatively, they can be set more permanantly be specifying them in /etc/portage/package.use:

@verbatim
dev-libs/gearbox hokuyo_aist
@endverbatim

A full list of available USE flags is given below. For a list of those provided by your current ebuild for Gearbox,
run \b equery \b uses \b gearbox.
<table><tr><td>doc</td><td>Installs the documentation</td></tr>
<tr><td>basic</td><td>Enable the basic example library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gbxadvanced</td><td>Enable the advanced example library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gbxgarminacfr</td><td>Enabled the GbxGarminAcfr GPS driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gbxserialacfr</td><td>Enable the GbxSerialAcfr serial communications library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gbxsickacfr</td><td>Enable the GbxSickAcfr SICK laser scanner driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gbxsmartbatteryacfr</td><td>Enable the GbxSmartBatteryAcfr SmartBattery driver.</td></tr>
<tr><td>gbxutilacfr</td><td>Enable the GbxUtilAcfr utilities library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>hokuyo_aist</td><td>Enable the hokuyo_aist Hokuyo laser scanner library.</td></tr>
</table>

@section gbx_doc_installgentoo_install Install

Run the following command to install Gearbox.

@verbatim
emerge gearbox
@endverbatim

Gearbox will be automatically downloaded, compiled with the options you have selected via USE flags, and installed.
Any necessary dependencies for the libraries to be installed will also be installed.

Gearbox will be installed with the prefix \b /usr. Remember to take this into account when setting
compile options such as library and include paths for your programs.

@section gbx_doc_installgentoo_uninstall Uninstall

To remove Gearbox from your system, run the following command.

@verbatim
emerge -C gearbox
@endverbatim
