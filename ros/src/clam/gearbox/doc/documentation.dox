@par Build Locally

To generate documentation, go to the @c doc directory on the top level of the GearBox distribution and run doxygen. (This works for both GearBox releases and the SVN version.)

@verbatim
$ cd [GEARBOX-SRC]/doc
$ doxygen doxyfile
@endverbatim

The documentation is created in a new directory called @c html. Use your browser to open @c [GEARBOX-SRC]/doc/html/index.html
